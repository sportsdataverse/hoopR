# **LKL Game Score**

Score line of a game: both scores and the clock text.

Endpoint: `GET https://lkl.lt/api/livestream/game-score/{game_id}`

## Usage

``` r
lkl_game_score(game_id)
```

## Arguments

- game_id:

  Required. lkl.lt game id (integer), e.g. 11446; `game_id` in
  lkl_results. Not sequential by season before 2018-19. Only a finished
  game is served.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble. One row: the two scores and the clock text. The
clock is NOT a state flag: an old game keeps `'1 KELINYS - 10:00'` after
the final, and a finished overtime game reads `'1 pratesimas - 00:00'`.
A body without scores gives a zero-row tibble. Every column below is
always present (a zero-row tibble keeps them and their types); an answer
with nothing in it raises `hoopR_no_data`, as in sdv-py.

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| game_id | integer | lkl.lt game id (key space: LKL games; the `{gameId}` of every route). Not sequential by season before 2018-19; not the Genius matchId. A frame parsed from a bare body has a null game_id when the body does not echo it (the runtime stamps it under `_request`). |
| home_score | integer | Home team points on the score line. |
| away_score | integer | Away team points on the score line. |
| clock | character | Clock text, NOT a state flag: an old game keeps '1 KELINYS - 10:00' after the final; a finished overtime game reads '1 pratesimas - 00:00'. |

## Details

Unofficial and unsupported: these are the routes lkl.lt's own game page
calls (found in its front-end bundle) and its server-rendered pages. The
site's robots.txt allows everything and sets no crawl-delay; the runtime
still spaces requests at least 1 s apart. SportsDataverse has not ruled
on the site's terms, so payloads are not redistributed as release
assets.

Coverage: game wrappers serve FINISHED games only (an unfinished game
raises `hoopR_asset_fetch`). The box score, summary, score line,
statistics and leaders answer for every season from 1993-94 (before
2024-25 the scoring splits and lead statistics are 0). Play-by-play and
shots exist from 2024-25 only; an earlier finished game raises
`hoopR_no_data`. From 2016-17 the results season id is also the Genius
LiveStats competition id (see the `genius` family) which holds
play-by-play for older games; lkl.lt game, team and player ids are
lkl.lt's own and do not join Genius ids. The King Mindaugas Cup shares
the routes but is not wrapped. Text fields are Lithuanian.

Errors: `hoopR_no_data` when lkl.lt has nothing for the request (HTTP
404, an unknown game or standings season, a season the site's selects do
not list, a season without played games, a finished game before 2024-25
asked for play-by-play or shots); `hoopR_bad_request` for a game id or
season that is not an integer, or HTTP 400 / 422; `hoopR_asset_fetch`
when the fetch failed or the answer is not the one asked for (an
unfinished game, a body or page for another game or season, an error or
changed body, a truncated results list). All inherit `hoopR_error`.
Dates and times are Lithuanian local (Europe/Vilnius) as the site prints
them.
