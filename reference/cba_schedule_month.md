# **Get CBA Schedule Month**

Game count per day of one calendar month.

Endpoint: `GET https://data-server.cbaleague.com/api/schedules/month`

## Usage

``` r
cba_schedule_month(year, month)
```

## Arguments

- year:

  (required) Required. CALENDAR year (not the season).

- month:

  (required) Required. Calendar month, 1-12.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble: One row per day with games: date and game count.
An empty valid answer is a zero-row tibble with these columns, in this
order (sdv-py `cba_schedule_month`):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| schedule_num | integer | Number of games scheduled on that day (0 = none). |
| schedule_time | character | The day as 'YYYY-MM-DD 00:00:00' (China local time, no zone); one row per calendar day of the month. |

## Details

- Unofficial and unsupported: these wrappers read the routes that
  cbaleague.com's own data site (a Vue single-page app) calls.
  SportsDataverse has not ruled on the site's terms, so payloads are not
  redistributed as release assets. Requests are spaced at least 1 s
  apart per host; keep use small.

- Access: every response body is AES-128-ECB encrypted with a public key
  shipped in the site's front-end bundle; the runtime decrypts it with
  [`digest::AES()`](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/digest/man/AES.html)
  (digest is a suggested package: install it to use these wrappers) and
  refuses anything that does not decrypt. The host blocks datacenter IPs
  at TCP: set the environment variable `CBA_PROXY` (or
  `options(hoopR.proxy = ...)`) to a residential proxy URL; it is never
  printed or put in a condition. Without a proxy the request goes direct
  and, from a datacenter, fails within seconds (a 5 s connect timeout,
  no retry of a refused or timed-out connect). Where direct access works
  (a residential IP), set `CBA_DIRECT=1` for the full 60 s timeout and
  retries.

- Seasons: the API's season is the START year; every `season` argument
  here is the END year (2026 = 2025-26) and is sent as `season - 1`.
  Columns named `season` keep the wire value (the START year, so the sdv
  END year is `season + 1`). The season list reaches 1995-96; box data
  before 2009-10 is unverified.

- Coverage: game wrappers serve FINISHED games only. Each first reads
  the game report header (cached per session), and an unfinished game
  raises `hoopR_asset_fetch`. Box, period, roster and best-player bodies
  are checked against that header (points sum to the score, team ids
  match, advanced rows are box players). Play-by-play is served one
  period per request: every period is fetched, and a partial set, an
  unordered clock or a final score the plays do not reach is refused.
  Play-by-play is verified on 2017-18 and 2025-26 only and is absent for
  2009-10 (`hoopR_no_data`). There are NO shot x/y coordinates in this
  API (shot location exists only as team and player zone splits), and
  play-by-play has no player or team ids (Chinese sentence text plus
  surnames). Box data has 12-minute quarters in 2009-10 and 2017-18 and
  10-minute quarters in 2025-26. The women's CBA is not covered (no
  official source).

- Not game data:
  [`cba_game_team_shots()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_game_team_shots.md)
  and
  [`cba_game_team_four()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_game_team_four.md)
  answer the two teams' SEASON tables (the shot zones are the teams'
  current profile; the four factors are the previous season), whichever
  game is asked for. The reference lists
  ([`cba_team_options()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_team_options.md),
  [`cba_team_counts()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_team_counts.md))
  and
  [`cba_report_status()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_report_status.md)
  are not echoed by the API, so their scope is unchecked.

- Duplicate rows: in some games (2025-26 game 100105799) the
  advanced-box and extras routes repeat player rows (26 rows for 12
  players), and the repeats are not always copies.
  [`cba_player_advanced()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_player_advanced.md)
  and
  [`cba_player_extras()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_player_extras.md)
  keep the FIRST row per `player_id`.

- Text fields are Chinese (names, play-by-play sentences, position and
  nationality labels). The column descriptions here are ASCII; sdv-py's
  `tools/codegen/notes/cba_glossary.yaml` holds the full English
  glossaries.

- Personal data: the operator ids (`createdBy` / `lastModifiedBy`, one
  holds a mobile number) and any bare mobile-number string are removed
  from every body. Players' public bio fields (birth date, height,
  weight) are kept.

- Ids: `schedule_id` (games, one global 9-digit sequence 100xxxxxx),
  `team_id` (clubs, stable across sponsor renames), `player_id`
  (persons) and `match_type_id` are integers. The roster registration
  `id` of
  [`cba_rosters()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/cba_rosters.md)
  is a 19-digit integer that an R integer or double cannot hold exactly,
  so it is kept as its exact digits (character).

- Errors are classed conditions: `hoopR_no_data` (HTTP 404, a game
  without play-by-play), `hoopR_bad_request` (a non-integer id or
  season, HTTP 400 / 422) and `hoopR_asset_fetch` (any other non-200,
  including HTTP 500, which this API answers for a body it dislikes and
  which is not retried; a dead connection; an empty or undecryptable
  body; an unfinished game; a body for another game, team, season or
  day), all inheriting `hoopR_error`. HTTP 429 / 502 / 503 / 504 are
  retried, up to three attempts. Wrappers raise; they never warn and
  return empty.
