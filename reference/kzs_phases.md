| phase_id | integer | Competition-phase id. Joins to `competitions[].competitionPhaseId` on matches and `/competitions/{competitionId}` `phases[].id`. |
| name | character | Phase name, Slovenian: 'Redni del' = regular season, 'Cetrtfinale' = quarterfinal, 'Polfinale' = semifinal, 'Finale' = final, '1. del' / '2. del' = first / second stage. |
