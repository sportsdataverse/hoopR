A `hoopR_data` tibble: One team's directory entry; resolves the
historical teams easl_teams does not list. An empty answer raises
`hoopR_no_data`; the columns are always these, in this order
(sportsdataverse-py `easl_team`):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| team_row_id | integer | The sync server's own integer row id of the team (not a DataCore id; inactive teams interleave, so ids of /teams rows have gaps). |
| team_id | character | teamId: DataCore team (entity) UUID v1 (key space: EASL teams, the same id as `entityId`; joins /teams, /standings team.id, fixture competitors, box and play-by-play teams). Not a player id. |
| name | character | Display name. Despite the field name this is the English / Latin-script name used on the league site. |
| name_native | character | Alternative name: the native-script name of some Japanese clubs (for example the Japanese-script name of Utsunomiya Brex), blank for most clubs; for players it usually equals nameFullLocal. Despite the field name it is not always Latin script. |
| code_latin | character | Three-letter club code (for example BRE); null or empty for some clubs. |
| code_local | character | Not yet populated upstream: null in every full body observed (2026-10-12), so its meaning is unverified; the 2026-27 bodies start filling some of these columns, so it is typed from its family (String). |
| standard | character | Competition standard: ELITE. |
| age_group | character | Not yet populated upstream: null in every full body observed (2026-10-12), so its meaning is unverified; the 2026-27 bodies start filling some of these columns, so it is typed from its family (String). |
| gender | character | Competition gender of the team: MALE (the EASL is a men's competition). |
| status | character | ACTIVE for teams in the current season (the only ones /teams lists), INACTIVE for historical teams (only via `/teams/{teamId}`). |
| primary_color | character | Not yet populated upstream: null in every full body observed (2026-10-12), so its meaning is unverified; the 2026-27 bodies start filling some of these columns, so it is typed from its family (String). |
| secondary_color | character | Not yet populated upstream: null in every full body observed (2026-10-12), so its meaning is unverified; the 2026-27 bodies start filling some of these columns, so it is typed from its family (String). |
| tertiary_color | character | Not yet populated upstream: null in every full body observed (2026-10-12), so its meaning is unverified; the 2026-27 bodies start filling some of these columns, so it is typed from its family (String). |
| logo | character | Club logo URL on the Sportradar DataCore asset CDN (images.dc.connect.sportradar.com/b1e0z/...). |
| website | character | Club website URL; most clubs have none. |
| facebook_username | character | Club Facebook handle; most clubs have none. |
| twitter_username | character | Club X / Twitter handle; most clubs have none. |
| instagram_username | character | Club Instagram handle; some clubs have none. |
| wikipedia_url | character | Club Wikipedia URL (DataCore column); empty for every ACTIVE team. |
| organization_id | character | DataCore organisation id: b1e0z (EASL). |
| created_at | character | When the sync server inserted the row, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' (a different format from updatedAt; zone unstated, UTC assumed). |
| updated_at | character | When the sync server last synced the row, ISO 8601 with milliseconds and Z (UTC). |
