# **Get P. LEAGUE+ Officials**

The referee and the two umpires printed under the header of one finished
game (names only).

Endpoint: `GET https://pleagueofficial.com/game/{gid}`

## Usage

``` r
pleague_officials(gid)
```

## Arguments

- gid:

  Required. P. LEAGUE+ game id on the site: ONE global integer sequence
  over every stage and season (197 = the 2022-23 opener, 662 = the
  2025-26 opener), e.g. 197; `gid` in pleague_schedule. Only finished
  games are served.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble: The referee and the two umpires printed under the
header of one finished game (names only). An empty valid answer is a
zero-row tibble with these columns, in this order (sdv-py
`pleague_officials`):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| gid | integer | P. LEAGUE+ game id on the site: ONE global integer sequence over every stage and season (1-12 = 2020-21 pre-season, 13 = the 2020-21 opener, 197 = the 2022-23 opener, 662 = the 2025-26 opener), with gaps; a row id, not a count. The {gid} of /game/{gid}. |
| official_no | integer | 1-based position of the official in the printed line (referee first). |
| role | character | Role translated: referee ((Chinese text), the crew chief), first_umpire ((Chinese text), literally 'first inspector'), second_umpire ((Chinese text)). Null for a role this table does not know. |
| role_zh | character | Official's role as printed: (Chinese text) = referee, (Chinese text) = first umpire, (Chinese text) = second umpire. |
| name_zh | character | Official's name in Traditional Chinese. Names only: the page carries no ids or contact data. |

## Details

- Unofficial use of a public source: these wrappers read
  pleagueofficial.com (P. LEAGUE+, Taiwan's men's league), keyless. The
  site's /user-policy (members' terms, section 11) reserves all content
  on the site to the service and its rights holders and forbids use,
  copying, adaptation or distribution without authorisation (it says
  nothing about automated access); robots.txt holds only Cloudflare
  content-signal comment lines with no Allow, Disallow or Crawl-delay
  rule. Use for reference only; payloads are not redistributed as
  release assets, and a data release needs owner sign-off. Requests are
  spaced at least 1 s apart per host, retries included.

- Access: the site sits behind Cloudflare. sdv-py fetches it with
  curl_cffi (Chrome TLS); this R port sends a browser User-Agent through
  libcurl, which was served on a live check (2026-10-18); Cloudflare may
  still answer a request with an HTTP 403 challenge page
  (`hoopR_asset_fetch`). Redirects are not followed: the site answers an
  unknown `gid` or a season before 2020-21 with a 302 to the home page
  (`hoopR_no_data`).

- Coverage: schedules, standings and player tables from 2020-21
  (`season = 2021`); box scores for every finished game from 2020-21;
  play-by-play (with shot x / y) from 2022-23 (gid 191 on). 2020-21 and
  2021-22 pages embed an empty game uuid, so they have no play-by-play
  and no Preciser data (`hoopR_no_data`). A game is keyed by `gid`: ONE
  global integer sequence over every stage and season. Only finished
  games are served: an unplayed game, or a box or play-by-play that does
  not match its game page (the routes echo no id, so the game page is
  fetched first, cached for the session, and the body's scores, quarters
  and points are checked against it), raises `hoopR_asset_fetch`.

- Seasons are END years (2025 = the site's slug '2024-25'). Text is
  Traditional Chinese as printed (names, venues, play-by-play phrases);
  the column descriptions gloss it in English. Ids: `team_id` (1-8) is
  stable across renames; the box `player_id` is the player-team
  membership. The box `random_id` is UNRELIABLE before 2022-23 (gid 13
  gives one player another player's page id): join box rows on
  `player_id`, and box rows to Preciser shots on `person_id`, never on
  `random_id`. The date of birth is dropped from the player frame;
  officials appear by name only.

- Errors are classed conditions, all inheriting `hoopR_error`:
  `hoopR_no_data` (HTTP 404, a redirect, a stage the season does not
  have, a game with no play-by-play, a season before 2020-21),
  `hoopR_bad_request` (an invalid argument, HTTP 400 / 422) and
  `hoopR_asset_fetch` (any other non-200, a dead connection, an empty or
  unreadable body, a page for another game, season, stage or player, an
  unfinished game, layout drift, a play-by-play phrase outside the
  observed vocabulary). HTTP 429 / 502 / 503 / 504 are retried, up to
  three attempts; HTTP 500 is NOT retried (the site answers 500 for an
  unknown id). Wrappers raise; they never warn and return empty.
