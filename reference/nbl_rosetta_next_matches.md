# **NBL Rosetta Next Matches**

Each team's next matches: opponent, venue and start time.

Endpoint:
`GET https://prod.rosetta.nbl.com.au/get/next/matches/for/teams/in/{org}/{season}`

## Usage

``` r
nbl_rosetta_next_matches(season, org = "nbl")
```

## Arguments

- season:

  (*integer* required): Season END year (2026 = 2025-26). The runtime
  maps it to Rosetta's year: the START year for the NBL and WNBL from
  1998-99, the calendar year for NBL1 and the NBL / WNBL winter seasons
  up to 1998. END 1998 and 1999 both read Rosetta year 1998, which holds
  two seasons; the matches frame keeps the one asked for.

- org:

  (*character* default `"nbl"`): Organisation: nbl (men's NBL), wnbl
  (women's) or nbl1 (the second tier, men's and women's conferences).
  One of `"nbl"`, `"wnbl"`, `"nbl1"`.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble (one row per team and upcoming match):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| org | character | Organisation the row belongs to: nbl, wnbl or nbl1. From the row's competition, else from the request. |
| rosetta_team_id | character | Rosetta's own id (UUID v4; v5 on NBL1) of the team; routes that take this entity accept it as well as the DataCore id. |
| team_name | character | Name of the team as Rosetta spells it, e.g. Perth Wildcats. |
| team_code | character | Team code, e.g. PER (the `{team_code}` path value) |
| division | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| conference | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| match_slug | character | URL slug of the upcoming match, e.g. sydney-kings-v-nz-breakers-men-14-10-2026. |
| match_title | character | Title of the upcoming match, e.g. Sydney Kings v NZ Breakers men 14-10-2026. |
| start_time_datetime | character | Start of the upcoming match, UTC, ISO 8601 text without an offset. |
| is_home | logical | True when the row's team is the home team of the upcoming match. |
| opponent_name | character | Name of the opponent in the upcoming match. |
| venue | character | Name of the venue (arena) of the upcoming match. |
| match_id | character | DataCore fixture id of the match (UUID v1): the `{match_id}` route key and fixtureId in play-by-play. Join on it. |
| rosetta_match_id | character | Rosetta's match RECORD id (UUID v4) as carried by box-score and play-by-play rows; no route accepts it. Join on match_id. |
| rosetta_opponent_id | character | Rosetta's own id (UUID v4; v5 on NBL1) of the opponent; routes that take this entity accept it as well as the DataCore id. |
| season_end_year | integer | sdv season key: the END year of the season (2026 = 2025-26), derived from season_year (a START year for the NBL and WNBL from 1998-99, a calendar year for NBL1 and the 1979-1997 winter seasons; year 1998 is split on the start date). Where the body carries no year it is the season asked for. |

Columns the body adds beyond these follow, in body order
(sportsdataverse-py keeps them too).
