# **Get the MBB cross-source schedule crosswalk**

Build a wide, one-row-per-game crosswalk linking ESPN and Bart Torvik
(barttorvik.com) game identifiers for an MBB season. Fox Sports and
Yahoo game IDs are NA placeholders. KenPom game IDs are optionally
enriched when `include_kenpom = TRUE` and credentials are set (see
below). Dates are reduced to Eastern-Time game dates before joining;
Torvik `team1`/`team2` are unordered (the join uses a sorted team-pair
key, so home/away from the Torvik side is not preserved). Games where
either Torvik team name cannot be resolved to an ESPN id via
[`mbb_team_crosswalk()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/mbb_team_crosswalk.md)
are kept as `bart_only` rows.

**KenPom (optional):** KenPom requires a paid subscription. Set the
environment variables `KP_USER` (email) and `KP_PW` (password) and pass
`include_kenpom = TRUE`. When `include_kenpom = FALSE` (the default) or
when credentials are absent, `kp_game_id` is left as `NA` and no network
calls to KenPom are made. Errors from individual team schedule calls are
silently dropped so the function always returns a complete crosswalk
even when partial KenPom data is unavailable.

## Usage

``` r
mbb_schedule_crosswalk(
  season = most_recent_mbb_season(),
  include_kenpom = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- season:

  Season year (4-digit, e.g. `2025`). Defaults to
  [`most_recent_mbb_season()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/most_recent_mbb_season.md).

- include_kenpom:

  Logical. When `TRUE` AND `KP_USER` is set, attempts to enrich
  `kp_game_id` via per-team
  [`kp_team_schedule()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/kp_team_schedule.md)
  calls. Default `FALSE`.

## Value
