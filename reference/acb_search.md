# **Get ACB Search**

Search players, teams and coaches by name.

One row per hit; `kind` is player, team or coach. The sample holds
players only (`teams` and `coaches` came back empty), so the team and
coach row shapes are unverified. `person_id` is the licence number for
players and coaches (a team hit carries its team entry id).

Endpoint: `GET https://api2.acb.com/api/seasondata/Search/search`

## Usage

``` r
acb_search(search_term, limit = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- search_term:

  (required) Name fragment (accent-insensitive on the player rows); a
  blank term is refused.

- limit:

  (default `NULL`) Maximum results per kind (players, teams, coaches). A
  whole number; a whole double is accepted.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble, one row per record described above; the columns
are always these, in this order (sdv-py `acb_search`):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| kind | character | player, team or coach. |
| person_id | integer | ACB licence number (players, coaches) or the team entry id (teams). |
| name | character | Display name (nickname) of a player or coach; the team name of a team. |
| short_name | character | Short display name ('T. Martin'). |
| first_name | character | Legal first name(s) |
| last_name | character | Legal last name(s) |
| shirt_number | character | Shirt number, a string (” or null when unknown) |
| game_role | character | Position or staff role, in Spanish: Base (point guard), Escolta (shooting guard), Alero (small forward), Ala-pivot (power forward), Pivot (centre); Entrenador (head coach), Segundo Entrenador / Entrenador Ayudante (assistant coach). Null or ” in many rows |
| is_license_active | logical | The licence is active in the current season |
| club_id | integer | Stable club id of a team hit; null for players. |
| edition_id | integer | Season id of the record; null in search results. |
| season | integer | Season END year (2027 = 2026-27) = edition_id + 1936: the key the wrappers take. |

## Details

- Legal notice (sdv-internal-refs/acb/README.md, aviso legal of acb.com
  read 2026-10-12): ACEB, S.A.U. claims intellectual property in the
  site's databases (the EU sui generis database right) among its other
  content. It authorises viewing and private copies for personal or
  journalistic use with the source credited, and requires prior express
  consent for distribution, reproduction or public communication. These
  wrappers fetch on the user's behalf; a published data release or a
  hosted mirror needs the owner's decision first. robots.txt allows the
  paths.

- Unofficial and unsupported: api2.acb.com is the .NET API behind
  acb.com and live.acb.com, not a documented public API. It needs the
  header `X-APIKEY`, a public key shipped in acb.com's bundle: the
  runtime sends the documented value (`$ACB_API_KEY` overrides it),
  re-reads the live bundle once on a 401, and never prints the key.

- Seasons: the API keys a season by `editionId` = season START year -
  1935 (91 = 2026-27, 48 = 1983-84, the first). The wrappers take
  `season`, the END year (2027 = 2026-27), and the runtime sends
  `editionId = season - 1936`. A route that omits `season` serves the
  current edition. `team_id` is a season-team entry (new every season);
  `club_id` is the stable club.

- Coverage: box scores from 1983-84 (old seasons carry only the
  whole-game period, quarter 0); play-by-play and shots from 2016-17
  (earlier games answer empty lists, which raise `hoopR_no_data`). Shot
  coordinates come in two systems, split by match id: millimetres from
  the attacked basket from 2020-21 (`coord_system` mm), a 0-100
  full-court percent grid before (grid). A game that is not finished
  (`matchFinished` false) raises `hoopR_asset_fetch` for the routes that
  report it.

- Errors are classed conditions, all inheriting `hoopR_error`:
  `hoopR_no_data` (HTTP 404 / 204, a route whose rows are empty: an
  unknown id, a game outside a playoff series, play-by-play or shots
  before 2016-17, a club with no games that season), `hoopR_bad_request`
  (a missing, unknown or non-integer argument or a season before 1984,
  raised before any request; HTTP 400 / 422) and `hoopR_asset_fetch` (a
  key the API still rejects after one re-read of the bundle, any other
  non-200 after three attempts, a non-JSON or `problem+json` body, an
  error envelope or empty stub, a body for another season, round, club,
  player or match, a game that is not finished). Wrappers raise; they
  never warn and return empty.
