# **Get LBA Teams Leaderboard**

Season team leaderboards, offensive or defensive, one row per team and
category.

Endpoint:
`GET https://www.legabasket.it/api/statistics/get-teams-statistics-by-type`
(`cs_id=1&type=<board>&s=<season>`)

## Usage

``` r
lba_teams_leaderboard(board, season = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- board:

  (required) Board: teams_offensive or teams_defensive. One of
  `"teams_offensive"`, `"teams_defensive"`.

- season:

  Season END year (2027 = 2026-27). Omitted = the site's default season
  (unverified).

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble: Season team leaderboards, offensive or defensive,
one row per team and category. The columns are always these, in this
order (sdv-py `lba_teams_leaderboard`); a column the site adds later is
appended after them:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| season | integer | Season END year (2027 = 2026-27): the row's START year + 1. |
| category | character | Category of this row (the `cat` param, e.g. `points`). |
| name | character | Given name (players) / team name (teams). |
| sponsor_name | character | Sponsor name (empty or null in the samples). |
| short_name | character | Short name of the team, e.g. BC Roma. |
| tv_name | character | Short team name for TV graphics. |
| year | integer | Season START year (2026 = 2026-27); sdv END year = year + 1. |
| logo_key | character | Image key: the image is `{cdn_url}/{key}`, resized copies `{cdn_url}/variants/{key}/thumb` or `/large` (the site's getApiImageUrl). |
| attempts | integer | Shots attempted in the zone, parsed from num. |
| total_played_matches | integer | Games the team has played, counted for the leaderboard. |
| total_points | integer | Points scored (offensive) or allowed (defensive) in the season. |
| minutes | integer | Minutes per game (players: decimal string `28.67`) / total minutes (teams: integer). |
| score_40_min | double | Value per 40 minutes. |
| score | double | Value in the category under the `ob` order (default `avg` = per game); players send a decimal string, teams a number. |
| team_id | integer | Team id (team-season). |

## Details

- Unofficial and unsupported: these wrappers read the JSON API that the
  Next.js site www.legabasket.it itself calls. Legal notice: the site's
  terms say "Non e' consentito copiare ... dati e informazioni senza
  autorizzazione scritta" (copying data and information without written
  authorisation is not allowed), except for personal, non-commercial
  use. The owner accepted the restriction for this intake on 2026-10-12.
  Payloads are not redistributed as release assets, and any published
  data release of this source needs separate sign-off.

- robots.txt allows /api and sets Crawl-delay: 2. The runtime waits 2 s
  before every request, retries included. Crawl incrementally: fetch a
  final game once (keyed by game_id), find new games with one
  lba_calendar call per round, and do not backfill a history in a burst.

- Seasons are END years (2027 = 2026-27); the site sends START years and
  the runtime maps them (season - 1 on the wire). Game and player ids
  are global; team ids are re-issued every season (join lba_teams for
  the stable club_id); a championship id is one season AND one phase
  (Regular Season and Play Off differ).

- Play-by-play starts in 2017-18 and changes shape in 2019-20 (pixel
  frame to court percent) and 2021-22; see lba_pbp. Box scores reach
  back to 1995-96, where the period scores were not recorded (0 means
  missing).

- Errors are classed conditions, all inheriting `hoopR_error`:
  `hoopR_no_data` (HTTP 404, or a body with no rows: an unknown season,
  a play-by-play before 2017-18, standings of a finished championship
  without a round), `hoopR_bad_request` (a season that is not an END
  year, a bad choice, HTTP 400 / 422) and `hoopR_asset_fetch` (any other
  non-2xx, a connection failure after retries, an empty / non-JSON /
  error-shaped 200, a game that is not final on the box score,
  play-by-play and shot routes, a truncated page, or a body for another
  season, championship, game, team, player, round or category than the
  one asked for). An unknown id is HTTP 500, which is not retried. A
  body the parser finds no rows in gives a zero-row tibble with these
  columns.
