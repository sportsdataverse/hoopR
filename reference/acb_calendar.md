# **Get ACB Calendar**

Every round of a season with its games: one call lists every game id.

One row per game with its round (`round_id`, `round_number`) and the
teams looked up in the body's team list. The cheapest way to crawl a
season: one call lists every game id.

Endpoint:
`GET https://api2.acb.com/api/seasondata/Calendar/season-calendar`

## Usage

``` r
acb_calendar(competition_id = NULL, season = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- competition_id:

  (default `NULL`) Competition id: 1 Liga Endesa, 2 Copa del Rey, 3
  Supercopa Endesa, 10 Minicopa Endesa (youth). Omitted = the API's
  default competition. A whole number; a whole double is accepted.

- season:

  (default `NULL`) Season END year (2027 = 2026-27; the first ACB
  season, 1983-84, is 1984). `acb_runtime` sends the API's `editionId` =
  season - 1936. Omitted = the current season. A whole number; a whole
  double is accepted.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble, one row per record described above; the columns
are always these, in this order (sdv-py `acb_calendar`):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| competition_id | integer | Competition id: 1 Liga Endesa, 2 Copa del Rey, 3 Supercopa Endesa, 10 Minicopa Endesa. |
| edition_id | integer | Season id (editionId) = season START year - 1935 (91 = 2026-27). The wrappers take the END year, `season`. |
| season | integer | Season END year (2027 = 2026-27) = edition_id + 1936: the key the wrappers take. |
| round_id | integer | Global round id (6017 = Liga 2026-27 round 3); not the round number. |
| round_number | integer | Round number within its phase. |
| subphase_id | integer | Sub-phase id of the round (playoff stages); null in the regular season. |
| subphase_number | integer | Sub-phase number of the round; null in the regular season. |
| week_id | integer | Not sent by the calendar route (always null). |
| match_id | integer | Match id. Legacy ids (seasons up to 2019-20) sit below about 20000 (12559 = 2005-06 final, 17718 = 2016-17 final); from 2020-21 they start at about 100000 (102920 in 2021-22, 105401 in 2026-27). One key space across competitions: the matchId param of every matchdata route. |
| home_team_id | integer | Home season-team entry id (new every season; joins the body's team list). |
| away_team_id | integer | Away season-team entry id (new every season; joins the body's team list). |
| home_score | integer | Home points (null before the match) |
| away_score | integer | Away points (null before the match) |
| start | POSIXct | Tip-off, ISO 8601 UTC |
| status | character | Match state (x-match-statuses) |
| is_on_half_time | logical | At half time (live) |
| current_quarter | integer | Current or last quarter (5+ = overtime); not reliable after the match (1 in the 2017 series rows) |
| home_club_id | integer | Stable club id of the home team (looked up in the body's team list). |
| home_team | character | Home team name for the season (looked up in the body's team list). |
| home_team_abbr | character | Home team three-letter abbreviation (looked up in the body's team list). |
| away_club_id | integer | Stable club id of the away team (looked up in the body's team list). |
| away_team | character | Away team name for the season (looked up in the body's team list). |
| away_team_abbr | character | Away team three-letter abbreviation (looked up in the body's team list). |
| ticketing_link | character | Ticket shop URL; null when none. |
| broadcasters | character | Broadcast channel names of the game joined with '; ' (the first is the primary). |

## Details

- Legal notice (sdv-internal-refs/acb/README.md, aviso legal of acb.com
  read 2026-10-12): ACEB, S.A.U. claims intellectual property in the
  site's databases (the EU sui generis database right) among its other
  content. It authorises viewing and private copies for personal or
  journalistic use with the source credited, and requires prior express
  consent for distribution, reproduction or public communication. These
  wrappers fetch on the user's behalf; a published data release or a
  hosted mirror needs the owner's decision first. robots.txt allows the
  paths.

- Unofficial and unsupported: api2.acb.com is the .NET API behind
  acb.com and live.acb.com, not a documented public API. It needs the
  header `X-APIKEY`, a public key shipped in acb.com's bundle: the
  runtime sends the documented value (`$ACB_API_KEY` overrides it),
  re-reads the live bundle once on a 401, and never prints the key.

- Seasons: the API keys a season by `editionId` = season START year -
  1935 (91 = 2026-27, 48 = 1983-84, the first). The wrappers take
  `season`, the END year (2027 = 2026-27), and the runtime sends
  `editionId = season - 1936`. A route that omits `season` serves the
  current edition. `team_id` is a season-team entry (new every season);
  `club_id` is the stable club.

- Coverage: box scores from 1983-84 (old seasons carry only the
  whole-game period, quarter 0); play-by-play and shots from 2016-17
  (earlier games answer empty lists, which raise `hoopR_no_data`). Shot
  coordinates come in two systems, split by match id: millimetres from
  the attacked basket from 2020-21 (`coord_system` mm), a 0-100
  full-court percent grid before (grid). A game that is not finished
  (`matchFinished` false) raises `hoopR_asset_fetch` for the routes that
  report it.

- Errors are classed conditions, all inheriting `hoopR_error`:
  `hoopR_no_data` (HTTP 404 / 204, a route whose rows are empty: an
  unknown id, a game outside a playoff series, play-by-play or shots
  before 2016-17, a club with no games that season), `hoopR_bad_request`
  (a missing, unknown or non-integer argument or a season before 1984,
  raised before any request; HTTP 400 / 422) and `hoopR_asset_fetch` (a
  key the API still rejects after one re-read of the bundle, any other
  non-200 after three attempts, a non-JSON or `problem+json` body, an
  error envelope or empty stub, a body for another season, round, club,
  player or match, a game that is not finished). Wrappers raise; they
  never warn and return empty.
