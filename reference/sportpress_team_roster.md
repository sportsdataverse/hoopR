## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble: Roster of one competition team (current entries
only). An empty valid answer raises `hoopR_no_data`; the columns are
always these, in this order (sportsdataverse-py
`sportpress_team_roster`):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| roster_id | integer | Roster id (key space: sportpress roster entries): one player on one competition team in one season, so a player has a new roster_id for every team and season. player_id is the person. |
| competition_team_id | integer | Competition-team id (key space: sportpress competition teams): a team in ONE competition, so a club has a new id every season (Antwerp = 3 in 2021-22, 506 in 2025-26, 541 in 2026-27). uu_team_id is the stable club key. |
| jersey | character | Shirt number as text; the box score sends it as an integer, so a zero-padded '00' is already lost there. |
| weight | integer | Weight in kg; null when unknown. |
| height | integer | Height in cm; null when unknown. |
| active | logical | True for a current roster entry; the lists hold current entries only. |
| position_id | integer | Position id (key space: sportpress positions; 3 = small_forward). |
| position | character | Position code: point_guard, shooting_guard, small_forward, power_forward, center, and the hybrids point_guard-shooting_guard, shooting_guard-small_forward, small_forward-power_forward, power_forward-center. |
| player_id | integer | Player id (key space: sportpress persons): stable across seasons and teams, distinct from roster_id. Not a Genius or FIBA person id. |
| first_name | character | Given name of the player as entered in the CMS. |
| last_name | character | Family name of the player as entered in the CMS. |
| nationality_code | character | Nationality code in FIBA style (USA, BEL, NED): DIRTY, with lower-case variants, '/'-joined pairs (USA/BEL), the empty string and 'HOL'; normalise before joining. |
| birth_date | Date | Date of birth as shown on the public player page; null when unknown. |
