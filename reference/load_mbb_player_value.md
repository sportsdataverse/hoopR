Loads season-level NBA player-impact ratings – one row per
player-team-season, combining regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM),
statistical plus-minus (SPM), box plus-minus (BPM), wins above

the sdv-py NBA/WNBA possession-engine model program; published to the
`nba_player_impact` release tag as csv/parquet/rds.

Loads season-level NCAA men's college basketball player-value ratings –

quality for the model); this tag is parquet-only, with no csv/rds
sibling assets. Produced by the sdv-py NCAA MBB model program; published
to the `mbb_player_value` release tag.

Loads season-level NCAA men's college basketball team ratings – one row
per team-season, with adjusted (opponent-strength-normalized)
offensive/defensive efficiency, adjusted tempo, raw efficiency, and a
national rank. A KenPom-style adjusted-efficiency-margin rating. This
tag is parquet-only, with no csv/rds sibling assets. Produced by the
sdv-py NCAA MBB model program; published to the `mbb_ratings` release
tag.
