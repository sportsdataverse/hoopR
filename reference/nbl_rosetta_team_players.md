# **NBL Rosetta Team Players**

Roster of one team in a season: player bio, jersey and position.

Endpoint:
`GET https://prod.rosetta.nbl.com.au/get/{org}/players/for/team/{team_id}/in/season/{season}`

## Usage

``` r
nbl_rosetta_team_players(team_id, season, org = "nbl")
```

## Arguments

- team_id:

  (*character* required): Team id: the DataCore id (team_id of
  nbl_rosetta_teams) or Rosetta's own id; either is accepted.

- season:

  (*integer* required): Season END year (2026 = 2025-26). The runtime
  maps it to Rosetta's year: the START year for the NBL and WNBL from
  1998-99, the calendar year for NBL1 and the NBL / WNBL winter seasons
  up to 1998. END 1998 and 1999 both read Rosetta year 1998, which holds
  two seasons; the matches frame keeps the one asked for.

- org:

  (*character* default `"nbl"`): Organisation: nbl (men's NBL), wnbl
  (women's) or nbl1 (the second tier, men's and women's conferences).
  One of `"nbl"`, `"wnbl"`, `"nbl1"`.

| player_id | character | DataCore id (UUID v1, Sportradar) of the player; stable across seasons and the id to join on across routes. |
| rosetta_player_id | character | Rosetta's own id (UUID v4; v5 on NBL1) of the player; routes that take this entity accept it as well as the DataCore id. |
| player_first_name | character | The player's given name, e.g. Elijah. |
| player_last_name | character | The player's family name, e.g. Pepper. |
| player_full_name | character | Given and family name. |

| player_dominant_hand | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| player_gender | character | Gender (MALE/FEMALE upper case on seasons and players, male/female lower case on competitions and divisions; UNKNOWN seen) |

| player_rookie_year | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| season_end_year | integer | sdv season key: the END year of the season (2026 = 2025-26), derived from season_year (a START year for the NBL and WNBL from 1998-99, a calendar year for NBL1 and the 1979-1997 winter seasons; year 1998 is split on the start date). Where the body carries no year it is the season asked for. |

Columns the body adds beyond these follow, in body order
(sportsdataverse-py keeps them too).
