# **NBL Rosetta Team Players**

Roster of one team in a season: player bio, jersey and position.

Endpoint:
`GET https://prod.rosetta.nbl.com.au/get/{org}/players/for/team/{team_id}/in/season/{season}`

## Usage

``` r
nbl_rosetta_team_players(team_id, season, org = "nbl")
```

## Arguments

- team_id:

  (*character* required): Team id: the DataCore id (team_id of
  nbl_rosetta_teams) or Rosetta's own id; either is accepted.

- season:

  (*integer* required): Season END year (2026 = 2025-26). The runtime
  maps it to Rosetta's year: the START year for the NBL and WNBL from
  1998-99, the calendar year for NBL1 and the NBL / WNBL winter seasons
  up to 1998. END 1998 and 1999 both read Rosetta year 1998, which holds
  two seasons; the matches frame keeps the one asked for.

- org:

  (*character* default `"nbl"`): Organisation: nbl (men's NBL), wnbl
  (women's) or nbl1 (the second tier, men's and women's conferences).
  One of `"nbl"`, `"wnbl"`, `"nbl1"`.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble (one row per roster entry):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| org | character | Organisation the row belongs to: nbl, wnbl or nbl1. From the row's competition, else from the request. |
| jersey_number | character | Jersey number, a STRING. |
| playing_position | character | Playing position code (G, F, C, PG, SF, FC, ...); null when not recorded. |
| team_id | character | DataCore id (UUID v1, Sportradar) of the team; stable across seasons and the id to join on across routes. |
| rosetta_team_id | character | Rosetta's own id (UUID v4; v5 on NBL1) of the team; routes that take this entity accept it as well as the DataCore id. |
| team_name | character | Name of the team as Rosetta spells it, e.g. Perth Wildcats. |
| team_code | character | Team code, e.g. PER (the `{team_code}` path value) |
| team_gender | character | Gender (MALE/FEMALE upper case on seasons and players, male/female lower case on competitions and divisions; UNKNOWN seen) |
| player_id | character | DataCore id (UUID v1, Sportradar) of the player; stable across seasons and the id to join on across routes. |
| rosetta_player_id | character | Rosetta's own id (UUID v4; v5 on NBL1) of the player; routes that take this entity accept it as well as the DataCore id. |
| player_first_name | character | The player's given name, e.g. Elijah. |
| player_last_name | character | The player's family name, e.g. Pepper. |
| player_full_name | character | Given and family name. |
| player_jersey_number | character | Jersey number, a STRING. |
| player_playing_position | character | Playing position code (G, F, C, PG, SF, FC, ...); null when not recorded. |
| player_active | logical | Player record is active. |
| player_date_of_birth | character | Date of birth, ISO date. |
| player_nationality | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| player_height | double | Height in centimetres. |
| player_weight | double | Weight in kilograms. |
| player_dominant_hand | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| player_gender | character | Gender (MALE/FEMALE upper case on seasons and players, male/female lower case on competitions and divisions; UNKNOWN seen) |
| player_nationality_code | character | Nationality, ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code. |
| player_birthplace | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| player_rookie_year | character | Unobserved in samples (null in every capture); type and meaning unverified. |
| season_end_year | integer | sdv season key: the END year of the season (2026 = 2025-26), derived from season_year (a START year for the NBL and WNBL from 1998-99, a calendar year for NBL1 and the 1979-1997 winter seasons; year 1998 is split on the start date). Where the body carries no year it is the season asked for. |

Columns the body adds beyond these follow, in body order (sdv-py keeps
them too).

## Details

- Unofficial: the JSON proxy behind nbl.com.au (not an API the NBL
  documents or supports). The terms of use were not reviewed; payloads
  are not redistributed as release assets.

- Gated by a referer, not a key: every request carries Origin / Referer
  set to nbl.com.au (the runtime sends them); without them the host
  answers 403 MISSING_API_KEY, which is raised as `hoopR_asset_fetch`.

- Fills a hole in ESPN: ESPN's nbl feed has box scores but no plays for
  the 2025-26 NBL season (the stats provider changed from Genius Sports
  to Sportradar DataCore that year). nbl_rosetta_match_pbp has the full
  event log with shot x/y for 2025-26 and, in the same shape, back to
  2011-12 (WNBL about 2014-15). Matches from 1979 have box scores only.

- One host serves three organisations; pass org='nbl' (default), 'wnbl'
  or 'nbl1'. NBL1 is the second tier (men's and women's conferences,
  calendar-year seasons).

- Season = the END year (2026 = 2025-26) everywhere. Rosetta's own year
  is the START year for the NBL and WNBL from 1998-99 and a calendar
  year for NBL1 and the 1979-1997 winter seasons; the runtime maps it.
  Year 1998 holds two seasons (calendar 1998 and 1998-99).

- Ids: `<entity>`*id columns are DataCore ids (UUID v1; join on them),
  rosetta*`<entity>`\_id Rosetta's own. match_id is the DataCore fixture
  id every match route is keyed on.

- Unknown ids, orgs and types answer 200 with no rows (`hoopR_no_data`).
  Rosetta caches a body per path and serves it whatever the query
  string, so a page cut by someone else's limit is refused
  (`hoopR_asset_fetch`); retry after the cache entry expires.

Errors: `hoopR_no_data` when Rosetta answers 404 or no rows (an unknown
match, team, player or season id, an org or season type with nothing, or
no season in progress); `hoopR_asset_fetch` for the 403 gate body, a
stub or error envelope, a page cut by Rosetta's path cache, a body for
another org, season or entity than the one asked for, or any other
failed fetch; `hoopR_bad_request` for an unknown `org` / `season_type`,
a malformed id, or HTTP 400 / 422.

     nbl_rosetta_team_players(
       org = "nbl", season = 2026, team_id = "befee10a-410c-11f0-b3f4-1b3c55488bbb"
     )
