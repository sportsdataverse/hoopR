# **Get KBL Rounds**

The season's round calendar (the KBL plays six rounds) with each round's
first and last date.

Endpoint: `GET https://api.kbl.or.kr/league/rank/{season}/team-tracks`

## Usage

``` r
kbl_rounds(season, division = "kbl", game_code = "01")
```

## Arguments

- season:

  Season END year (2026 = 2025-26; the inaugural 1997 season is 1997,
  the latest 2027). kbl_runtime maps it to the KBL seasonCode (47 =
  2025-26).

- division:

  'kbl' (the KBL itself, the default) or 'd_league' (the KBL D-League
  reserve league, seasonGrade 2, which has its own season codes; it
  starts with the 2009 summer edition).

- game_code:

  Competition inside the season, two digits: '01' regular season
  (default; the first stage of a D-League edition), '03' playoffs, '04'
  championship final, '07' EASL, '08' D-League stage 2, '10' All-Star,
  '11'/'13' cups, '14' Open Match Day. Only '01' was probed live.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble: The season's round calendar (the KBL plays six
rounds) with each round's first and last date. The columns are always
these, in this order (sportsdataverse-py `kbl_rounds`); an empty valid
answer raises `hoopR_no_data`, a valid body with no rows for this frame
is a zero-row tibble:
