# **Get ACB Next Matches**

A club's most recent and upcoming games.

One row per game (recent and upcoming around today); same columns as
`acb_matchlist`.

Endpoint:
`GET https://api2.acb.com/api/seasondata/TeamProfile/next-matches`

## Usage

``` r
acb_next_matches(
  club_id,
  number_of_matches = NULL,
  competition_id = NULL,
  season = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- club_id:

  (required) ACB club id (integer), stable across seasons and sponsor
  names (2 = Barca, 9 = Real Madrid, 13 = Valencia Basket). Not the
  season-team `team_id`. A whole number; a whole double is accepted.

- number_of_matches:

  (default `NULL`) How many games to return (the site asks for 5). A
  whole number; a whole double is accepted.

- competition_id:

  (default `NULL`) Competition id: 1 Liga Endesa, 2 Copa del Rey, 3
  Supercopa Endesa, 10 Minicopa Endesa (youth). Omitted = the API's
  default competition. A whole number; a whole double is accepted.

- season:

  (default `NULL`) Season END year (2027 = 2026-27; the first ACB
  season, 1983-84, is 1984). `acb_runtime` sends the API's `editionId` =
  season - 1936. Omitted = the current season. A whole number; a whole
  double is accepted.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble, one row per record described above; the columns
are always these, in this order (sportsdataverse-py `acb_next_matches`):

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| match_id | integer | Match id. Legacy ids (seasons up to 2019-20) sit below about 20000 (12559 = 2005-06 final, 17718 = 2016-17 final); from 2020-21 they start at about 100000 (102920 in 2021-22, 105401 in 2026-27). One key space across competitions: the matchId param of every matchdata route. |
| round_type | character | Phase code: LR = Liga Regular (regular season), PO = playoffs (a bundle value, not in the samples); null on every row of /Menu/competition-data and /TeamProfile/next-matches |
| round_id | integer | Round id: global across seasons, not the round number (6017 = Liga 2026-27 round 3; 2600 = 2016-17 round 1) |
| round_number | integer | Round number within the phase |
| group_id | integer | Group id in group-stage competitions |
| subphase_id | integer | Sub-phase id inside a phase (a playoff round or a cup round, e.g. 291, 292, 293); null in the regular season |
| subphase_number | integer | Sub-phase number |
| week_id | integer | Week id: global across seasons (2989 = the week of 2026-10-10) |
| status | character | Match state (x-match-statuses) |
| is_on_half_time | logical | At half time (live) |
| current_quarter | integer | Current or last quarter (0 before the match and in some finished rows) |
| home_score | integer | Home points (null before the match) |
| away_score | integer | Away points (null before the match) |
| start | POSIXct | Tip-off, ISO 8601 UTC |
| home_wins | integer | Home team's wins so far |
| home_losses | integer | Home team's losses so far |
| away_wins | integer | Away team's wins so far |
| away_losses | integer | Away team's losses so far |
| home_team_id | integer | Season-team id: one team's entry in one competition edition (4467 = Barca in Liga 2026-27, 4388 = Real Madrid in Liga 2025-26). Changes every season and competition. Joins every `homeTeamId` / `awayTeamId` / `teamId` / `teamEditionId`. Not the club id. |
| home_club_id | integer | Club id, stable across seasons and sponsor names (2 = Barca, 9 = Real Madrid, 13 = Valencia Basket): the `clubId` request param and every `homeClubId` / `awayClubId`. |
| home_team | character | Team name that season (sponsor names change) |
| home_team_abbr | character | Three-letter abbreviation (BAR, RMB) |
| away_team_id | integer | Season-team id: one team's entry in one competition edition (4467 = Barca in Liga 2026-27, 4388 = Real Madrid in Liga 2025-26). Changes every season and competition. Joins every `homeTeamId` / `awayTeamId` / `teamId` / `teamEditionId`. Not the club id. |
| away_club_id | integer | Club id, stable across seasons and sponsor names (2 = Barca, 9 = Real Madrid, 13 = Valencia Basket): the `clubId` request param and every `homeClubId` / `awayClubId`. |
| away_team | character | Team name that season (sponsor names change) |
| away_team_abbr | character | Three-letter abbreviation (BAR, RMB) |
| competition_id | integer | Competition id: 1 Liga Endesa, 2 Copa del Rey, 3 Supercopa Endesa, 10 Minicopa Endesa (x-competitions) |
| edition_id | integer | Season id (`editionId`) = season START year - 1935 (91 = 2026-27, 81 = 2016-17, 70 = 2005-06, 48 = 1983-84, the first). The sdv season (END year) is editionId + 1936. Season lists also carry `seasonStartYear` / `seasonEndYear` |
| season | integer | Season END year (2027 = 2026-27) = edition_id + 1936: the key the wrappers take. |
| is_selected_local | logical | Not sent by this route (always null). |
