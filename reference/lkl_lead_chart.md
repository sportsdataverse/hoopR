# **LKL Lead Chart**

Lead chart of a game: the score margin at each chart point of each
period.

Endpoint: `GET https://lkl.lt/api/livestream/game-stats/{game_id}`

## Usage

``` r
lkl_lead_chart(game_id)
```

## Arguments

- game_id:

  Required. lkl.lt game id (integer), e.g. 11446; `game_id` in
  lkl_results. Not sequential by season before 2018-19. Only a finished
  game is served.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble. One row per chart point, periods ascending and
points in clock order. `diff` is home minus away (signed); `score_home`
/ `score_away` are the cumulative scores (the site sends strings);
`clock` is the clock REMAINING as the site's `mm:ss:00` text (a trailing
`:00`; `10:00:00` is the period start); `column_height` is the bar
height (`abs(diff) / maxDiff x 50`). A 2007-08 game has a flat chart (no
event data then). A body without `leads` gives a zero-row tibble. Every
column below is always present (a zero-row tibble keeps them and their
types); an answer with nothing in it raises `hoopR_no_data`, as in
sdv-py.

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| game_id | integer | lkl.lt game id (key space: LKL games; the `{gameId}` of every route). Not sequential by season before 2018-19; not the Genius matchId. A frame parsed from a bare body has a null game_id when the body does not echo it (the runtime stamps it under `_request`). |
| period | integer | Period number: 1-4 regulation, 5 the first overtime, 6 the second. |
| diff | integer | Home minus away score at that chart point (signed integer). |
| clock | character | Clock REMAINING in the period as the site's 'mm:ss:00' text (a trailing ':00'): '10:00:00' is the period start. |
| score_home | integer | Home cumulative score at that point (the site sends a string). |
| score_away | integer | Away cumulative score at that point (the site sends a string). |
| column_height | double | Bar height for the site's chart: abs(diff) / maxDiff x 50 (percent of the chart). |

## Details

Unofficial and unsupported: these are the routes lkl.lt's own game page
calls (found in its front-end bundle) and its server-rendered pages. The
site's robots.txt allows everything and sets no crawl-delay; the runtime
still spaces requests at least 1 s apart. SportsDataverse has not ruled
on the site's terms, so payloads are not redistributed as release
assets.

Coverage: game wrappers serve FINISHED games only (an unfinished game
raises `hoopR_asset_fetch`). The box score, summary, score line,
statistics and leaders answer for every season from 1993-94 (before
2024-25 the scoring splits and lead statistics are 0). Play-by-play and
shots exist from 2024-25 only; an earlier finished game raises
`hoopR_no_data`. From 2016-17 the results season id is also the Genius
LiveStats competition id (see the `genius` family) which holds
play-by-play for older games; lkl.lt game, team and player ids are
lkl.lt's own and do not join Genius ids. The King Mindaugas Cup shares
the routes but is not wrapped. Text fields are Lithuanian.

Errors: `hoopR_no_data` when lkl.lt has nothing for the request (HTTP
404, an unknown game or standings season, a season the site's selects do
not list, a season without played games, a finished game before 2024-25
asked for play-by-play or shots); `hoopR_bad_request` for a game id or
season that is not an integer, or HTTP 400 / 422; `hoopR_asset_fetch`
when the fetch failed or the answer is not the one asked for (an
unfinished game, a body or page for another game or season, an error or
changed body, a truncated results list). All inherit `hoopR_error`.
Dates and times are Lithuanian local (Europe/Vilnius) as the site prints
them.
