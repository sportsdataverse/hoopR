# **Get ACB Quick Facts**

Pre-match facts per team: standing, record, recent results.

One row per team (`team_side` home then away): `standing` is the league
position, `wins` / `losses` the record before the game, `last_results`
the recent results joined with `'; '` (`WIN` / `LOSS`).

Endpoint: `GET https://api2.acb.com/api/matchdata/Preview/quickfacts`

## Usage

acb_quickfacts(match_id)

  (105401 = Barca 89-86 Valencia Basket, Liga 2026-27 round 3). A whole
  number; a whole double is accepted.
