# **Genius Match Competition**

The competition (comp_id and name) a game belongs to, from its LiveStats
HTML shell.

Endpoint:
`GET https://fibalivestats.dcd.shared.geniussports.com/u/{org}/{match_id}/`

A one-row tibble: the only way to map a `data.json` game to its
competition (`comp_id`) and, through
[`genius_competitions()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/genius_competitions.md),
to a season. `org` is the ORG the request used.

## Usage

``` r
genius_match_competition(org, match_id, return_parsed = TRUE)
```

## Arguments

- org:

  LiveStats ORG of the game's shell (can differ from the hosted ORG: NZN
  vs NZNBL).

- match_id:

  Genius match id (`match_id` of
  [`genius_schedule()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/genius_schedule.md),
  [`genius_widget_games()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/genius_widget_games.md)
  or
  [`genius_competition_games()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/genius_competition_games.md)),
  e.g. 2902690.

- return_parsed:

  Parse into a tibble (default `TRUE`); `FALSE` returns the parsed body
  or page record (a list): `data.json` as served plus `_request` (the
  ids asked for), or the sdv-internal-refs capture shape of a page.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble (a zero-row tibble with these columns when Genius
answers an empty valid page), or the raw list when
`return_parsed = FALSE`:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| match_id | integer | Match id from the page's hidden input \#matchId (equals the {matchId} asked for). Genius match id: the {matchId} of data.json and /u/; one global sequence across every Genius customer (~0.3 M in 2016, ~2.9 M in Oct 2026) |
| comp_id | integer | Competition id from the hidden input \#compId. Genius competition id (compId): one per org competition-season; the {compId} of hosted and data/competition paths. The way to map a data.json game to its competition and season |
| competition_name | character | Competition label from \#competitionName, free text ('Stoiximan GBL 2026-2027'); carries the season only when the org writes it in |
| org_label | character | First item of og:description: the org's display code (ESAKE) |
| og_description | character | The page's og:description: `<ORG> , <competition>, Check out the full statistics here` |
| org | character | ORG code the request used (the hosted ORG, or the LiveStats ORG for the /u/ shell). |

## Details

**Access.** The Genius hosts publish no robots.txt and no terms.
CloudFront refuses datacenter IPs on the LiveStats and hosted hosts:
from a server set `options(hoopR.proxy = ...)` or the `GENIUS_PROXY`
environment variable to an http(s) proxy URL (never printed or logged).
Requests are spaced at least one second apart per host; keep crawls slow
and incremental. Some league sites (the NZ NBL) forbid AI crawlers in
their own robots.txt, which does not cover these hosts. Unofficial use
of a public source: payloads are not redistributed as release assets.

**Org and season.** Every competition is an ORG code plus a competition
id (`comp_id`):
[`genius_competitions()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/genius_competitions.md)
lists an org's competitions with the sdv END-year `season` (a START-year
org lists 2025-26 as season 2026), `genius_match_competition()` maps a
game to its competition, and `data.json` itself names no date,
competition or season. The hosted ORG can differ from the LiveStats ORG
of `/u/` (NZNBL vs NZN). Match ids are one global sequence across every
Genius customer. `data.json` carries no global team or player id: `tno`
(1 or 2) and `pno` are in-game numbers; only finished games are read.

**Errors** (classed conditions, all inheriting `hoopR_error`):
`hoopR_no_data` when Genius has nothing for the request (HTTP 404, the
S3 `AccessDenied` 403, an empty 200 from the hosted host, an empty
recent-games window, a schedule or widget with no matches);
`hoopR_bad_request` for HTTP 400 / 422 or a URL that is not a Genius
route (e.g. a non-numeric id); `hoopR_asset_fetch` when the answer is
unknown: the CloudFront "Request blocked" 403, a rate limit or 5xx, the
intermittent HTTP 500 "A website error has occurred" page
(`transient = TRUE`: retry later), a dead connection, an error envelope,
a cut-off page, an unfinished game, or a body for another match,
competition or ORG.
