# **NBL Rosetta Team Stats**

Team season totals and averages by period (0 = whole game, 1-4 quarters,
5 and up overtime).

Endpoint:
`GET https://prod.rosetta.nbl.com.au/get/{org}/team/stats/for/season/{season}/regular`

## Usage

``` r
nbl_rosetta_team_stats(season, org = "nbl", limit = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- season:

  (*integer* required): Season END year (2026 = 2025-26). The runtime
  maps it to Rosetta's year: the START year for the NBL and WNBL from
  1998-99, the calendar year for NBL1 and the NBL / WNBL winter seasons
  up to 1998. END 1998 and 1999 both read Rosetta year 1998, which holds
  two seasons; the matches frame keeps the one asked for.

- org:

  (*character* default `"nbl"`): Organisation: nbl (men's NBL), wnbl
  (women's) or nbl1 (the second tier, men's and women's conferences).
  One of `"nbl"`, `"wnbl"`, `"nbl1"`.

- limit:

  (*integer* default `NULL`): Rows to return. Omitted = a page large
  enough for the whole list (a short page cut by Rosetta's path cache is
  refused).

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble with one row per team and period. Its columns are
listed in
[return_columns](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/return_columns.md)
(`subset(return_columns, fn == "nbl_rosetta_team_stats")`) and in the
searchable [return
columns](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/articles/return-columns.html)
article.
