# **NBL Rosetta Team Stats**

Team season totals and averages by period (0 = whole game, 1-4 quarters,
5 and up overtime).

Endpoint:
`GET https://prod.rosetta.nbl.com.au/get/{org}/team/stats/for/season/{season}/regular`

## Usage

``` r
nbl_rosetta_team_stats(season, org = "nbl", limit = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- season:

  (*integer* required): Season END year (2026 = 2025-26). The runtime
  maps it to Rosetta's year: the START year for the NBL and WNBL from
  1998-99, the calendar year for NBL1 and the NBL / WNBL winter seasons
  up to 1998. END 1998 and 1999 both read Rosetta year 1998, which holds
  two seasons; the matches frame keeps the one asked for.

- org:

  (*character* default `"nbl"`): Organisation: nbl (men's NBL), wnbl
  (women's) or nbl1 (the second tier, men's and women's conferences).
  One of `"nbl"`, `"wnbl"`, `"nbl1"`.

- limit:

  (*integer* default `NULL`): Rows to return. Omitted = a page large
  enough for the whole list (a short page cut by Rosetta's path cache is
  refused).

Where the body carries no year it is the season asked for. |

Columns the body adds beyond these follow, in body order (sdv-py keeps
them too).

## Details

- Unofficial: the JSON proxy behind nbl.com.au (not an API the NBL
  documents or supports). The terms of use were not reviewed; payloads
  are not redistributed as release assets.

- Gated by a referer, not a key: every request carries Origin / Referer
  set to nbl.com.au (the runtime sends them); without them the host
  answers 403 MISSING_API_KEY, which is raised as `hoopR_asset_fetch`.

- Fills a hole in ESPN: ESPN's nbl feed has box scores but no plays for
  the 2025-26 NBL season (the stats provider changed from Genius Sports
  to Sportradar DataCore that year). nbl_rosetta_match_pbp has the full
  event log with shot x/y for 2025-26 and, in the same shape, back to
  2011-12 (WNBL about 2014-15). Matches from 1979 have box scores only.

- One host serves three organisations; pass org='nbl' (default), 'wnbl'
  or 'nbl1'. NBL1 is the second tier (men's and women's conferences,
  calendar-year seasons).

- Season = the END year (2026 = 2025-26) everywhere. Rosetta's own year
  is the START year for the NBL and WNBL from 1998-99 and a calendar
  year for NBL1 and the 1979-1997 winter seasons; the runtime maps it.
  Year 1998 holds two seasons (calendar 1998 and 1998-99).

- Ids: `<entity>`*id columns are DataCore ids (UUID v1; join on them),
  rosetta*`<entity>`\_id Rosetta's own. match_id is the DataCore fixture
  id every match route is keyed on.

- Unknown ids, orgs and types answer 200 with no rows (`hoopR_no_data`).
  Rosetta caches a body per path and serves it whatever the query
  string, so a page cut by someone else's limit is refused
  (`hoopR_asset_fetch`); retry after the cache entry expires.

Errors: `hoopR_no_data` when Rosetta answers 404 or no rows (an unknown
match, team, player or season id, an org or season type with nothing, or
no season in progress); `hoopR_asset_fetch` for the 403 gate body, a
stub or error envelope, a page cut by Rosetta's path cache, a body for
another org, season or entity than the one asked for, or any other
failed fetch; `hoopR_bad_request` for an unknown `org` / `season_type`,
a malformed id, or HTTP 400 / 422.
