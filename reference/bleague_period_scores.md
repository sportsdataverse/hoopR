# **B.LEAGUE Period Scores**

**Points each team scored in each period of one B.LEAGUE game, overtime
included.**

Endpoint:
`GET https://b-league.s3.amazonaws.com/web_json/v2_genius_contexts/{schedule_key}/{latest}.json`
(the v1 feed, or the game page's embed, when v2 does not hold the game).

One row per (period, team side): `points` are scored IN the period (not
cumulative). Periods run 1 to the game's `MaxPeriod` (4 when the header
has none); a period whose score slot is missing is skipped.

## Usage

``` r
bleague_period_scores(schedule_key, season = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- schedule_key:

  (*integer* required): B.LEAGUE ScheduleKey, one global sequence across
  B1, B2, B3 and every season, e.g. `504734` (B1 2025-26 sec 1, Alvark
  Tokyo v Utsunomiya Brex); the `schedule_key` column of
  [`bleague_schedule()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/bleague_schedule.md).

- season:

  (*integer* optional): a guard, the season END year the game must
  belong to; a context whose `Year` differs raises `hoopR_asset_fetch`.
  `NULL` (default) = no check (the key alone selects the game).

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble with one row per team and period. Its columns are
listed in
[return_columns](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/return_columns.md)
(`subset(return_columns, fn == "bleague_period_scores")`) and in the
searchable [return
columns](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/articles/return-columns.html)
article.
