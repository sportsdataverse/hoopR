# **B.LEAGUE Period Scores**

**Points each team scored in each period of one B.LEAGUE game, overtime
included.**

Endpoint:
`GET https://b-league.s3.amazonaws.com/web_json/v2_genius_contexts/{schedule_key}/{latest}.json`
(the v1 feed, or the game page's embed, when v2 does not hold the game).

One row per (period, team side): `points` are scored IN the period (not
cumulative). Periods run 1 to the game's `MaxPeriod` (4 when the header
has none); a period whose score slot is missing is skipped.

## Usage

``` r
bleague_period_scores(schedule_key, season = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- schedule_key:

  (*integer* required): B.LEAGUE ScheduleKey, one global sequence across
  B1, B2, B3 and every season, e.g. `504734` (B1 2025-26 sec 1, Alvark
  Tokyo v Utsunomiya Brex); the `schedule_key` column of
  [`bleague_schedule()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/bleague_schedule.md).

- season:

  (*integer* optional): a guard, the season END year the game must
  belong to; a context whose `Year` differs raises `hoopR_asset_fetch`.
  `NULL` (default) = no check (the key alone selects the game).

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble with these columns:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| schedule_key | integer | B.LEAGUE ScheduleKey (key space: B.LEAGUE games, ONE global integer sequence across B1, B2, B3 and every season). The {schedule_key} every game wrapper takes and the schedule page's list-item id. |
| season | integer | Season END year (2026 = 2025-26), the feed's Year (the START year) plus one. |
| feed | character | Source feed of the row: v2 (v2_genius_contexts, B1/B2 from 2020-21) or v1 (v1_contexts: B3, B1/B2 2018-2020, and the 2016-17 / 2017-18 game-page embed). The feeds differ in id types, dates and some codes. |
| period | integer | Period number: 1-4 regulation; overtime numbering is unverified (no overtime sample). |
| team_side | character | Side of the game the row belongs to: home or away. |
| team_id | character | B.LEAGUE TeamID as text (key space: B.LEAGUE clubs, stable across seasons AND club renames: 703 = Tochigi Brex in 2016-17 = Utsunomiya Brex in 2025-26). The feed sends a string on v2 and an integer on v1; both are text here. Not a player id. |
| points | integer | Points the team scored IN this period (not cumulative); from the header's score slots. |
