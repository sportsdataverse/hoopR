# **Get P. LEAGUE+ Preciser Rotation**

On-court stints of every player of one finished game (the rotation
chart).

Endpoint:
`GET https://api.preciser.io/game/rotation/chart/o/plg/gameId/{uuid}`

## Usage

``` r
pleague_preciser_rotation(uuid, gid = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- uuid:

  Required. The Preciser game uuid the site's game page embeds (`uuid`
  of pleague_game; empty before 2022-23, which have no vendor data),
  e.g. 'e6f98675-3e5b-11ed-949e-5d17350689cf' (gid 197).

- gid:

  Optional. The site's game id for this uuid. When given the runtime
  also fetches the site's game page and box (cached) and checks the
  vendor body against them (uuid, final score, made shots, roster and
  minutes); the uuid must be the game page's. Without it only the checks
  the body allows by itself run.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble: On-court stints of every player of one finished
