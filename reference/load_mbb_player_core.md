# **Load cleaned MBB player core (identity + bio) from the data repo**

helper that loads multiple seasons of ESPN MBB athlete core records –
identity and biographical fields, one row per athlete who appeared in
the season – from the sportsdataverse-data release repo, either into
memory or into a database via forwarded arguments in the dots.

This is the only source of athlete bio in the pipeline: the player
season stats payload carries no identity at all – not even the athlete
id.

Two properties of the source are worth knowing before joining:

- `current_team_id` is the athlete's CURRENT team, not their team in the
  requested season. Season team lives in
  [`load_mbb_player_box()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/load_mbb_player_box.md)
  /
  [`load_mbb_player_stats()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/load_mbb_player_stats.md).

- Bio (height / weight / jersey) is a current snapshot that ESPN
  overwrites in place; it is not era-correct for a historical season.
  The season dimension here is participation, not the bio's vintage.

Field coverage is era-dependent by nature – headshots exist only for
modern players, while college and date of birth thin out the other way.

## Usage

``` r
load_mbb_player_core(
  seasons = most_recent_mbb_season(),
  ...,
  dbConnection = NULL,
  tablename = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- seasons:

  A vector of 4-digit years associated with given MBB seasons. (Min:
  2003)

- ...:

  Additional arguments passed to an underlying function that writes the
  season data into a database (used by
  [`update_mbb_db()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/update_mbb_db.md)).

- dbConnection:

  A `DBIConnection` object, as returned by
  [`DBI::dbConnect()`](https://dbi.r-dbi.org/reference/dbConnect.html).

- tablename:

  The name of the player core data table within the database.

## Value

Returns a tibble of MBB athlete core records (one row per
athlete-season).
