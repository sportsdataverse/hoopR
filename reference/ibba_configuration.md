# **IBBA Configuration**

**Season settings: the season label, round counters and the standings
cut line.**

Endpoint: `GET https://basket.co.il/ws/ws.asmx/Configuration`

## Usage

``` r
ibba_configuration(season)
```

## Arguments

- season:

  (*integer* required): Season END year (2026 = 2025-26); sent to the
  host as `cYear` unchanged.

## Value

A `hoopR_data` tibble with these columns:

|  |  |  |
|----|----|----|
| col_name | type | description |
| season | integer | Season END year as an integer (2026 = 2025-26): the host's own cYear, no mapping. |
| season_label | character | Season label as 'YYYY-YY' ('2025-26', '2004-05'). |
| red_line | integer | Standings position the site draws its cut line under (12 in 2025-26, 10 in 2004-05); meaning inferred. |
| active_board_id | integer | Board id the site treats as the active competition (17 = final series in 2025-26, 5 = league in 2004-05); meaning inferred. |
| next_round | integer | Next round (game number) to be played; meaning inferred. |
| total_rounds | integer | Rounds in the regular season (32 in 2025-26, 22 in 2004-05); meaning inferred. |

## Details

The IBBA wrappers read the Israel Basketball Association's ASP.NET web
service at `basket.co.il/ws/ws.asmx` (the ops its own site calls):
seasons, boards, teams, rosters, coaches, schedules and results, box
scores from 2004-05, season stats and leaders of the Winner League
(Israeli Premier League). They mirror sdv-py's
`sportsdataverse.basketball.ibba` wrappers of the same names: same
arguments, the same snake_case columns and types, one row per sdv-py
row. The live box score, play-by-play and shot coordinates of a game are
in the
[`ibba_segev_game_info()`](https://hoopR.sportsdataverse.org/reference/ibba_segev_game_info.md)
family (Segev Stats).

**Unofficial and unsupported.** The web service is keyless, unofficial
and reverse engineered. Requests are spaced at least one second apart
per host (429 / 502 / 503 / 504 are retried three times; an HTTP 500 is
the host's deterministic error page, a stack trace, and is not retried);
keep crawls slow and incremental. Contact details (e-mail, phone, fax)
and coaches' dates of birth are dropped.

**Seasons and ids.** `season` is the END year and the host's own `cYear`
(2026 = 2025-26): it is sent unchanged. `team_id` and `player_id` are
per-SEASON registrations (Maccabi Tel Aviv = team 1109 in 2025-26, 2111
in 2026-27); the host has no cross-season person id (the stable player
key is the Segev player id of the `ibba_segev_*()` family). `team_uid`
is the stable club id (Maccabi = 10). A `0` means "all" where an
argument says so; every parameter of an op is always sent.

**Coverage.** League box scores from 2004-05 (`season = 2005`).
`external_id` and `segev_game_id` exist only from 2025-26 (earlier games
carry no Segev id, so `segev_game_id` is `NA`). The women's league and
Liga Leumit are NOT on this host. Every value on the wire is a string
and Hebrew text is HTML-entity encoded: ids, counts and dates are cast
and text is unescaped.

**Errors** are classed conditions, never a warning plus an empty frame:
`hoopR_no_data` (HTTP 404, an empty body, which is what an unknown id
answers, or an empty row list), `hoopR_bad_request` (HTTP 400 / 422, or
an argument that is not a non-negative integer, a boolean or a non-empty
string as the op needs) and `hoopR_asset_fetch` (any other failure:
another status, a transport error, a body that is not JSON, an error or
changed envelope, a row for another season, team, player, board or game,
or a box score of a game that is not final). All inherit `hoopR_error`.
