Description: An R package to quickly obtain clean and tidy men's
    basketball play by play data. The package has functions to access
    live play by play and box score data from ESPN with shot locations
    when available. It is also a scraping and aggregating
    interface for Ken Pomeroy's men's college basketball statistics
    website. It provides users with an
    active subscription to kenpom.com the capability to scrape the website tables and
    analyze the data for themselves.
